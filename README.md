# ids Azure Integration labs
There is a wealth of excellent tutorials on Integration Platform as a Service (iPaaS) out there including Microsoft's learn platform and MSDN. 

However I often need to refer back to notes whicle covering a wide range of topics and often you dont really get down to it until you solve a particular problem. This repo is here primarily for my own benefit but I hope others find it useful.
